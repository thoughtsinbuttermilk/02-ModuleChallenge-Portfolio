# Northwestern Full Stack Development Bootcamp Assignment 02

# Project description

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio site, hosted in GitHub Pages, for my work as a student in Northwestern's Full Stack Development Bootcamp. This assignment is due Monday, 12 June (12:59 p.m.). 

## User story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for the position.

## Acceptance criteria (_requirements_)

Given I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

1. When I load their portfolio, then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2. When I click on one of the links in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. When I click on the link to the section about their work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. When I am presented with the developer's first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. When I click on the images of the applications, then I am taken to that deployed application
6. When I resize the page or view the site on various screen sizes and devices, then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Status of this assignment, first submission
The current state of the application satisfies all but two of the requirements. The unsatisfied requirements are:
_"3. When I click on the link to the section about their work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications"_
and 
_"5. When I click on the images of the applications, then I am taken to that deployed application"_

Both issues will be addressed and the assignment re-submitted before midnight on Friday, 16 June.
## Notes for Instructor, Teaching Assistants, Graders

The source code for this project is in the `main` branch. I have not deleted the working branches I used to iterate over the changes, organize the project etc., in case those are of interest to you.

**Development process**

As I started this project, I considered how I would approach designing and developing the portfolio site from scratch and I how I would incorporate both learning new ideas and completing the project on time.

A loose outline of the process I tried to adhere to:
1. Start with a question: Apart from building the portfolio site, what else can I learn from this project? Answers:
- How to use VS Code more effectively
- How to use Figma
- GutHub Milestones and (better use of) Issues
- CSS Grid Layouts
- Practice more iterative development
- Better use of comments in source code
- Write simple, easy to understand and concise code
2. Translate the User Story and Acceptance Criteria into Design, Development stories NOTE: I should have added testing stories as well.
3. Research developer and design sites for inspirations and ideas
4. Create a paper mock-up, tear up the mock-up, start again!
5. Create a wireframe of the mock-up: does it scale? would the design be amenable to responsiveness?
6. Create a list of artifacts and decisions needed: fonts, colors, html structure, css selectors, etc., add to Design and Development stories
7. Begin work

_Learnings, areas of improvements_
1. One aspect of development I need to work on is focus. It's easy to become distracted by ideas for improvements (shiny, cool things to try) while researching and learning fondational concepts that will make future me a good developer.
2. Complete the requirements, first.
3. When writing comments, try to consider the perspective of the audience (in this case, the graders).
4. Keep commits small and discreet.
5. Keep development branch updated with `main`
6. Remember: often there's more than one thing contributing to the problem you are working on.
7. Test early, test often. Test the thing you are working on *and* the broader functionality of the application.
8. Oh! The irony of creating a portfolio that is not compliant with accessibility tools when my first project was a refactor for accessibility!

# Deployment, usage

The html site has been deployed using and can be viewed in a web browser or screen reader.

# Future updates

The repository will be updated when the missing requirements are address and, again, after the project is graded; all feedback will be incorporated.
