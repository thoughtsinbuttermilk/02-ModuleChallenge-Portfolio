          <p>
            I am a student at Notherwestern University studying full stack development while working full time.
            I am also a passionate photographer who practices, making and processing images every day (now and again, film).
            <!-- In 2020, I shot 7 cover photos for the <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/"> Chicago Reader.</a>  -->
            I love cooking, dogs and, especially, my partner's vegan baked goods!

          <p>
            Simply put, I make photos of the things we see everyday.
            Small scenes we see and forget.
            The man-made beauty of the architecture of cities.
            Seattle and Chicago are my homes.
            I hope you enjoy viewing the images as much as I enjoy making them.

              <p>The goal of this Nortwhestern full stack development project was to refactor an existing website to be compliant with accessibility standards and tools.
              The original source code was provided as part of the assignment.
              The requirements included refactoring  the sources without changing the useability or display of the site.
